so the you can step through the code with the customers and show them
the basics of creating a simple client from the ground.

	- paths.xml
	- resources.xml (located in fantasydemo/res and bigworld/res)
	- engine_config.xml
	- scripts_config.xml
	- bw.xml (located in bigworld/res/server)
	
- show them the code that connects to a server.

- show them how to create a player in an online space

- show them how to create a player in an offline space

- note: to connect to an online server you can edit scripts_config.xml and 
set the online tag to True and provide either a full ip address or owner 
name for the server
