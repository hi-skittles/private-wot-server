Presentation Notes for (Model Animation Demo):

This demo is used to demonstrate models and animations.

- describe what the model is made of (.model, .visual, .primitive)

- load models in the client using BigWorld.Model

- test model foreground and background loading using NUM1 (BigWorld.Model) and NUM2 (BigWorld.fetchModel)

- show model skeleton using NUM3

- attach models to hardpoints and nodes using python commands

- attach PyAttachments to hardpoints and nodes using python commands

- show tracker for PlayerAvatar (open Avatar.py)

- open the ranger model and create a new LOD then open it up in the demo.
toggle closeup view using NUM5 (note: the close up view will not show the base LOD model because the camera is close to the model)

- test motors using NUM 6 (servo) and NUM 7 (oscillator)

- show actions using python commands

- debug actions using NUM4 

- show queued up actions using python commands

- show action matcher using Model Editor and toggle debug Actions

Todos:

- create motor tests for oscillator2 and orbitor and fix up current motor tests
