    <h1>Graphs Help</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>Graphs</b> module is a set of tools for the
        graphical display of live and historical server statistics, collected
        by the StatLogger process.</p>
        
        <p>The StatLogger process is responsible for logging user-configurable
        collections of server metrics over time to either (or both) relational and
        Carbon-based metric databases. For further information, see the <b>"StatLogger"</b>
        chapter of the <b>Server Operations Guide</b>.
   
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            This version of the Graphs module is intended as a developer preview to
            demonstrate the use of Graphite/Carbon as an eventual replacement for the existing
            StatLogger relational database and existing <a href="/statg">Graphs module</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accordingly, some features of the original Graphs module are not
            included in this version.
        </p>

    <h2>Viewing Graphs</h2>
    <p>
        BigWorld server metrics can be visualised from the perspective of process type (via the <a href="by_process">Processes</a> page) or machine
        (via the <a href="by_machine">Machines</a> page). These views present
        an overview of all machines and processes. You can narrow these views down to specific machines, processes, or machine/process
        groups by following the links in the chart titles.
    </p>

    <h3>Toolbar</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the toolbar above the graph display to change the view.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Button</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_calendar_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>
              <td>Opens a calendar which lets you choose an end date and time for the graphing period (by default the current time is used). Use the drop-down menu beside this button to select the period of time to graph (the default is five minutes). 
              </td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_end_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>
              <td>Switches between live and historical mode.</td>

            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_gaps_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>
              <td>Shows or hides gaps in the data. Gaps indicate periods
              for which no data has been logged by StatLogger.</td>
             </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_yaxis_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_pivot_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>
              <td>Toggles statistics mode. In this mode metrics are grouped by statistic, instead of by machine or process. 
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_legend_26.png" height="20" width="20"/></td>
              <td>Toggles the display of the graph legend pane.</td>

    <h3>Graph Display</h3>

    <p>One or more graphs are displayed in this area. All graphs
    displayed are synchronised to the same time and display the
    same time range.</p>

    <p>If the number of subjects for graphing exceeds the maximum number of
    graphs, graph series are consolidated into groups alphabetically. When
    grouped, graph titles take the form "&lt;first-member-in-group&gt; -
    &lt;last-member-in-group&gt;". Specific graphs within a group may be
    "drilled into" by clicking the graph title.
    </p>

    <p>You can drill back up to previous graph view states by
    clicking the breadcrumb links to the left of the toolbar.</p>

    <h3>Setting the Graphing Period</h3>
    <p>
        To specify the graphing period, do any of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_calendar_13.png" height="13" width="13"/> button and specify an end date and time for the graphing period. Use the drop-down menu beside this button to select the period of time to graph.</li>
            <li>Hold down <b>Shift</b> and drag across the graph to select a specific time period.</li>
            <li>Pan left (backwards in time) or right (forwards in time) by dragging any of the displayed graphs left or right.</li>
            <li>Hold down <b>Shift</b> and use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in (increasing the graphing period) or out (decreasing the graphing period).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Live Mode</h3>
    <p>
        You can snap the current graphing period to the current time by
        clicking the <b>Live mode</b> <img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_end_13.png" height="13" width="13"/> button.
    </p>
    <p> Live mode will poll for new data no more often than the current
        point resolution. For example, data viewed at two second resolution will be polled
        once every two seconds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Any manual panning action while in live mode turns live mode off.
    </p>
    

    <h3>The Legend</h3>
    <p>
        Display of the legend pane is off by default, and can be toggled via the
        <b>Legend</b> <img src="static/html/images/sg_icon_legend_13.png" height="13" width="13"/> button.
        When shown, the legend pane displays the names and values of the graph 
        currently under the mouse pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The colours of metrics are as defined in the StatLogger
        preferences file ("preferences.xml"). For more information on this file,
        see <b>"Process Statistic Configuration"</b> in the <b>Server Operations
        Guide</b>.
