This library is from Google. The project home page is:
https://code.google.com/p/trace-viewer/

These are two steps to get this library work in our WebConsole:
1. Generate the trace-viewer.css and trace-viewer.js from source package
2. Apply Patches from BigWorldTech to the result of step 1 to make them work 
   properly in our WebConsole

Please refer to below sections for more detailed information.

**** Generate the trace-viewer.css and trace-viewer.js from source package *****
1. Download the source from the project home page, the latest src code has
   deleted the standalone build functionality, so checkout version 1329 instead
2. run trace_viewer/build/generate_standalone_timeline_view.py --js=trace-viewer.js --css=trace-viewer.css


********************* Apply Patches from BigWorldTech *************************
Search the existing trace-viewer.css and trace-viewer.js code in our code
repository with the keyword BigWorldTech to find out what modifications we have
made to the originally generated result. These modifications are expected to be
merged into your newly generated result if these issues still hold. 

You are also expected to add comments like this when new modifications are added.
