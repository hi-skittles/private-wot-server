	<h1>Admin Help</h1>
	
	<p>The <b>Admin</b> module allows you to manage the WebConsole user
	accounts and their permissions.</p>
	
	<p>Using this module you can: 
	<ul>
		<li>Add a new WebConsole user.</li>
		<li>Edit an existing WebConsole user.</li>
		<li>Delete a WebConsole user.</li>
		<li>Flush user mappings in bwmachined processes.</li>
		<li>Perform self profiling</li>
	</ul></p>

	
	<h2>Add a new WebConsole user</h2>

	<p>WebConsole now supports to create two different kinds of users: password
	based users and LDAP based users. However, WebConsole can only support one
	kind at the same time. With the default settings of WebConsole, users are
	password based. To support LDAP based WebConsole accounts, you need to
	change some WebConsole configuration. Please refer to
	<i>Server Operations Guide</i> for more details on configuring WebConsole to
	support LDAP based users.</p>

	<h3>Add a new password based WebConsole user</h3>
	<p>With default WebConsole settings, users are password based. To add a
	new user, click on the "Add User" menu item on the left hand side of the
	page. You will then be presented with a form to input these user
	information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Username: the user name for the new user, with which the new user
		will log in.</li>

		<li>Password: the password with which the new user will log in.</li>

		<li>Confirm Password: the password from the previous field, retyped to
		ensure no mistake was made on entry.</li>

		<li>Server User: The Linux user this account will be associated with.
		This will be the Linux user that the BigWorld server processes will be
		run as. If you are uncertain of this field, please talk to your system
		administrator to find out what your Linux user account is.</li>

		<li>Group: The user group for the new user. The group assigned
		determines what level of access that user will have to viewing and
		modifying their own server as well as others' servers. Groups
		permissions and access control features are discussed in further detail
		in the <i>Server Operations Guide</i>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once all the user information has been entered, simply click the
	<b>Add User</b> button. Error message will be displayed if there is any
	error during the backend creation process. Upon success, you will be
	returned to the main user listing, which will include the new user.</p>

	<h3>Add a new LDAP based WebConsole user</h3>

	<p>When authentication by LDAP has been enabled and LDAP server setting
	has been configured in WebConsole configration file, you can create LDAP
	based WebConsole users. To add a new LDAP based user, click on the
	"Add User" menu item on the left hand side of the page. You will then be
	presented with a form to input user information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Username: the user name for the new user, with which the new user
		will log in.</li>

		<li>Group: The user group for the new user. The group assigned
		determines what level of access that user will have to viewing and
		modifying their own server as well as others' servers. Groups
		permissions and access control features are discussed in further detail
		in the <i>Server Operations Guide</i>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Compared with adding a password based user, password and server user
	information are not required to input now. When creating this user,
	WebConsole will search the server user of this user from LDAP server by the
	attribute defined by WebConsole configuration item
	<b>identity.soldapprovider.serverUserNameAttr</b>. For the password,
	WebConsole will only use the password that user inputs when logging in and
	authenticate that password against LDAP, so WebConsole does not need to
	store it locally.</p>

	<p>Once the user name has been entered and group has been selected, simply
	click the Add User button. Then WebConosle will search the user information
	from LDAP server and create this user. Error message will be displayed if
	there is any error during this process. If the user is created
	successfully, you will be returned to the main user listing, which will
	include the new user.</p>

	<h2>Edit an existing WebConsole user</h2>

	<p>Edit an existing user is similar to create a new one.</p>

	<p>To edit an existing WebConsole user, go the the <b>Users</b> page and
	select <b>Edit</b> from the Action drop down menu of that user.</p>


	<h2>Delete a WebConsole user</h2>

	<p>To delete a WebConsole user, go the the <b>Users</b> page and select
	<b>Delete</b> from the Action drop down menu of that user.</p>
	
	<p>Note that the default admin account is not allowed to delete.</p>

	<h2>Flush user mappings in bwmachined processes</h2>

	<p>The Flush Users page provides the ability for WebConsole	to force all
	BWMachined instances in the network to forget their current	cached user
	list. This feature is useful and sometimes necessary when adding users to
	a network information system such as LDAP which are sometimes used as
	account management systems.</p>
	
	<p>If you are having problems detecting a newly added user in your network,
	or are seeing an old user appear in your cluster display, flushing the user
	mapping will quite often help resolve the issue.</p>

	<p>To flush user mappings, go to the <b>Flush Users</b> page and click the
	<b>Yes</b> button.</p>

	<h2>Perform self profiling</h2>

	<p>Perform self profiling and dump the results to a JSON file.</p>

	<p>To perform self profiling, go to the <b>Self Profiling</b> page, 
	specify the number of seconds to profile for, then click
	<b>Start Profiling</b>. <b>Note: </b>The recommended
	profiling duration is ten seconds or less. Entering a large figure will 
	result in the creation of large dump files (roughly 10 to 25 MB per second). 
	Chrome (currently the only supported browser) can take more than 30 minutes 
	to load dump files larger than 100MB and may crash when loading dump files 
	larger than 400MB.</p>
