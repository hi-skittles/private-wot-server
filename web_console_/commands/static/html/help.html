    <h1>Commands Help</h1>

    <p>The <b>Commands</b> module provides the ability to execute scripts
    from <b>WebConsole</b> without needing to connect to a linux machine
    and use developer / systems operator oriented tools.</p>

    <h2>Command Library</h2>

    <p>The <b>Library</b> page is designed to enable easy access to
    commonly used server functionality without requiring the user to
    have an in depth understanding of the server or lower level procedures.
    This enables common functions to be exposed for developers, game
    designers or even GMs.</p>

    <p>Any functions that are exposed on a CellApp or BaseApp either via a
    pyFunctionWatcher or a CallableWatcher will be displayed on this page.</p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>The <b>Command Library</b> table displays a list of available commands
    through which scripts are executed.  Scripts that appear here are
    generally commonly used functionality that is handy to expose for
    developers, game designers or even GM's.</p>

    <p>When a script is selected a description of that script will be
    displayed, along with a list of arguments the script function
    accepts, and an <b>Execute</b> button.</p>

    <p>Depending on how the script is defined and its intended purpose, the
    script may be run on one or more components. For example the
    <code>systemMessage</code> script as shipped in FantasyDemo will be run
    on all BaseApps, whereas the <code>addGuards</code> script will
    only be run on one BaseApp (the least loaded). Where the script runs
    is a design decision for the person who implements the script as
    outlined in the <b>Server Programming Guide</b>.</p>

    <p>The <b>Return Value</b> panel of the <b>Library</b> page
    will contain the value returned by the method called from each server
    component the script was run on. The output here should be prefixed by
    a component type and component number and is generally recommended to
    be a human readable string describing the result of the script call,
    however each script may return whatever they choose and return values
    should generally be outlined as part of the script description.</p>

    <p><b>Console Output</b> contains any stdout/stderr generated by the
    script call. In the case where multiple components generate output this
    will be output concatenated by component. The most likely occasion when
    output here will be of interest is in the case where a script generates
    an exception which needs to be debugged.</p>
