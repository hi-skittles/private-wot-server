    <h1>Consoles Help</h1>

	<p>The <b>Consoles</b> module provides the ability to access Python
	functionality (and even exposed C++ methods) from <b>WebConsole</b>
	without needing to connect to a linux machine and use developer / systems
	operator oriented tools.</p>


	<h2>Python console</h2>
	<p>The <b>Python Console</b> page provides a simple web interface to the
	Python telnet port of BaseApps, CellApps, ServiceApps and DBApp. Using
	the Python console, users can interactively call script commands on a
	server process, or inspect the state of the server.</p>

	<p>Previously, developers would have to use <code>`control_cluster.py
	pyconsole`</code>, or run telnet from the command line to access this
	functionality.</p>

	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>Opening the <b>Python Console</b> page presents the user with a list
	of active server components owned by the current user that have an exposed
	Python console.</p>

	<p>Each process has a <b>Connect</b> link which links to a terminal
	like page that is connected to the associated server component. The
	console page can also be accessed via the <b>Cluster</b> module's
	<b>Processes</b> page, and in the process <b>Action</b>
	drop-down list box selecting <b>Console</b> entry.</p>

	<p>The Python console page is designed to be similar to an interactive
	command line python console that most python developers should have
	encountered. Please note that accessing another user while connected to a
	Python console will cause a redirect to the Consoles list as the new 
	user.</p>
